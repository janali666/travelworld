                <h2>About Azad Kashmir</h2>
                <p>Azad Jammu and Kashmir abbreviated as AJK and colloquially referred to as simply Azad Kashmir, is a
                    region administered by Pakistan as a nominally self-governing entity and constituting the western
                    portion of the larger Kashmir region, which has been the subject of a dispute between India and
                    Pakistan
                    since 1947. Azad Kashmir also shares borders with the Pakistani provinces of Punjab and Khyber
                    Pakhtunkhwa to the south and west, respectively. On its eastern side, Azad Kashmir is separated from
                    the
                    Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir (part of Indian-administered Kashmir) by the Line of
                    Control
                    (LoC), which serves as the defacto border between the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of
                    Kashmir.
                    Geographically, it covers a total area of 13,297 km2 (5,134 sq mi) and has a total population of
                    4,045,366 as per the 2017 national census.</p>

            <h3>1.Baral Fort</h3>

            <p> Nestled in the picturesque landscape of Palandri, Azad Kashmir, Baral Fort stands as a testament to
                history’s
                enduring allure. This hidden gem has withstood centuries of time, revealing its secrets within a
                stunning
                natural backdrop. This fort was built by Maharaja Gulab Singh 1837 to dominate the Sadnoti areas of
                Plundry and
                beyond. Some other historians have claimed that this fort was built by the Ghakars during 17th century.
            </p>
            <p>Baral Fort’s towering walls and intricate architectural details transport you to a bygone era.
                Indo-Islamic
                influences are evident in the design, adding an exquisite touch to this historical marvel. It was a
                two-story
                fort with 18 rooms and two halls but that doesn’t exist now. The outer wall is still intact but in a
                depleted
                condition. It covers an area of 3 kanal. After partition, the same fort was used as a middle school from
                1947n
                till 1957. It needs serious restoration efforts.

            <h3>3. Mangla Dam</h3>

            <p>The Mangla Dam (Urdu: منگلا بند) is a multipurpose dam situated on the Jhelum River in the Mirpur
                District of
                Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. It is the sixth-largest dam in the world. The village of Mangla, which sits at
                the mouth
                of the dam, serves as its namesake. In November 1961, the project's selected contractors were revealed;
                it was
                announced that Binnie & Partners, a British engineering firm, was going to serve as the lead designers,
                engineers, and inspectors for the construction of the dam (led by Geoffrey Binnie). The project was
                undertaken
                by a consortium known as the Mangla Dam Contractors, which consisted of eight American construction
                firms
                sponsored by the Guy F. Atkinson Company based in South San Francisco, California.</p>
